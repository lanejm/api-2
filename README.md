# Random Photo Generator

This website utilizes the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) to get random images. 

By clicking the button, a new image will be generated on the screen.  The description and a timestamp for when it was uploaded will also appear.  

This project was part of the curriculum for Eleven Fifty Academy Gold Badge.

It pulls data from the API, utilizes GET only, uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling, and is deployed to [Firebase](firebase.google.com).
